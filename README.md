My Portfolio
    This is the Module-2 challenge. The task was to create a Portfolio to showcase my skills to future employers.
    The portfolio features a nav bar, a profile picture, an about me section, a work section and a contact me section.
    The nav bar is linked to the corresponding sections.
    The my work section contains pictures that are linked to the corresponing projects. In this case only the first project is linked.
    The first project appears larger than the others in the grid.
    Each project is labeled.
    The browser has a responsive layout when the viewport is changed.
